# Tic Tac Toe
I developped the famous Tic Tac Toe game based on python.
The idea behind the game is illustrated in the picture below.
Here are the steps when you run the project:
- Ask for the players' names
- Each player enters the box he wants to play (b0 for second column and first line)
- At the end, the program will display the winner or indicate a tie.
